## Phase 01 — Analysis & Planning

### 1️⃣ Understanding the Outlook Flow

The Outlook workflow represents how users typically handle professional communication through emails and calendar events.  
The AI Agent must understand and act upon these components:

- **Inbox Processing** – Read and categorize incoming emails (e.g., meeting invites, follow-ups, spam, task requests).
- **Smart Prioritization** – Identify high-priority messages based on sender, keywords, or deadlines.
- **Calendar Integration** – Detect meeting invitations, schedule events, and avoid time conflicts.
- **Task Extraction** – Identify actionable items from email bodies (e.g., *“Please send the report by Friday”* → create task).
- **Automated Replies** – Draft polite, context-aware responses or acknowledgments.
- **Summarization** – Provide daily/weekly summaries of pending or completed tasks.
- **Security & Compliance** – Respect privacy and ensure no sensitive data is mishandled.

The flow ensures that the AI agent mimics a human executive assistant within Outlook—efficiently sorting, summarizing, and acting on communication.

### 2️⃣ AI Agent Approach

The system will be built as a modular AI assistant that connects with Outlook data through the Microsoft Graph API.

**Core design ideas:**
- Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for intent and entity recognition within emails.  
- Apply **categorization** and **priority scoring** (via fine-tuned transformer models such as BERT or FinBERT).  
- Maintain a **local task database** (or simple JSON/SQLite) for task tracking and reminders.  
- Integrate with **calendar APIs** to schedule and update meetings automatically.  
- Employ **summarization LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5)** for concise daily summaries.  
- Follow **modular architecture**:
  - `email_reader.py` – fetches and cleans emails  
  - `nlp_classifier.py` – detects intent and extracts entities  
  - `scheduler.py` – manages events and tasks  
  - `summary_agent.py` – produces summaries and drafts replies  
  - `main.py` – orchestrates all components
